# Enhanced Intrusion Detection for IoT: Utilizing Neural Network-based Weighted Classes for Handling Imbalanced Data

This project aims to solve the imbalance of classes within the dataset while providing a multi-output prediction model. It includes data processing, analysis, balancing techniques, and a multi-output neural network for data training.Â 

# Steps to Execute the Code
Step 1: Load the Dataset
Ensure you have the Bot-IoT dataset downloaded and available in your working directory. If not, you can download it from the Bot-IoT dataset repository.

Step 2: Combine Data Scenarios
Run the Bot_IoT_combine_data_scenarios.ipynb notebook to combine several scenarios of the Bot-IoT dataset. This notebook merges multiple datasets into a single dataset for further processing.
1.Open Bot_IoT_combine_data_scenarios.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2.Execute all cells to combine the datasets.
