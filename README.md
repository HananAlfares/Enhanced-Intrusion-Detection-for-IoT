# Enhanced Intrusion Detection for IoT: Utilizing Neural Network-based Weighted Classes for Handling Imbalanced Data

This project aims to solve the imbalance of classes within the dataset while providing a multi-output prediction model. It includes data processing, analysis, balancing techniques, and a multi-output neural network for data training.Â 


# Steps to execute the code: 
1- load the dataset
2- apply Bot_IoT combine data secnarious.ipynb code to combine several scenarios of Bot-IoT dataset. 
3- apply the BoT_IoT preprocessing.ipynb for data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, null values, mixed data type, and categorical data columns.
4- execute the (Enhanced Intrusion Detection for IoT: Neural Network-based Imbalanced Data Handling and Feature Reduction.ipynb.ipynb) for combining the cost-sensitive learning trained with multi-output neural network to predict both category and subcategory class of the data
